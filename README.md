# ADVANCE DATA STRUCTURES

## Introduction
  The project utilises advance data structures and algorithms to find the shortest path in a Maze. There is a competition between `BFS` & `A-Star` algorithms to find the shortest  path. Main aim of this project is to compare the running time and number of nodes searched by the two algorithms (BFS vs A*) in the process of finding the shortest path in maze.
  
## Algorithms Compared
```
  - Breadth First Search
  - A-star (A*)
 ```
  
## Technologies Used
- Java
- Canvas GUI
- Java AWT
- Java Swing

## Run Application
- Clone the repository
- Compile all the java classes in the repository
- Run the test.java after comiling all classes
- Load the files Sword and Maze to view predefined mazes.
