# ADVANCE DATA STRUCTURES
- ## Introduction
  The project utilises advance data structures and algorithms to find the shortest path in a Maze. There is a competition between `BFS` & `A-Star` algorithms to find the shortest  path.
  
- ## Algorithms Compared
  - Breadth First Search
  - A-star (A*)
  
- ## Technologies Used
  - Java
  - Canvas GUI
  - Java AWT
  - Java Swing
